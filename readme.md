This is yet another implemntation of A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

Fast methods like texture nets and other will be implimented later 

Intially it base on https://github.com/Lasagne/Recipes/blob/master/examples/styletransfer/   [1]

Key features are following:

1. Instead vgg based content loss  Frabnius norm of difference beween images  was used.

2. Optimization by adam gradient decent.

3. Special constraint on colors ( gray scale only option)
